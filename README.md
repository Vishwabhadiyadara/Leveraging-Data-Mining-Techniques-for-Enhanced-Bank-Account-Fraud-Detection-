# Leveraging Data Mining Techniques for Enhanced Bank Account Fraud Detection

## Overview

The proliferation of digital banking has significantly increased the sophistication and frequency of fraudulent activities, posing a critical threat to both financial institutions and their customers. Traditional fraud detection systems, often based on rule-based algorithms, are increasingly inadequate, plagued by high false positive rates and a lack of adaptability to new fraud tactics. This project explores the application of data mining and supervised machine learning techniques to improve fraud detection, using the PaySim synthetic dataset to model and analyze mobile money transactions. This research aims to advance the methodologies for fraud detection, providing a scalable, effective solution for financial institutions.

## Goals

- To apply data mining and supervised learning techniques for improved fraud detection in banking transactions.
- To evaluate the performance of various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
- To address the challenges of class imbalance and model generalization in fraud detection.

## Technologies Used

- Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and model implementation.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning model training and evaluation.
- SMOTE for addressing class imbalance in the dataset.
